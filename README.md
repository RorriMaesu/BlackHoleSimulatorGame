Welcome to **BlackHoleSimulatorGame** – the only place where launching planets into black holes is not only encouraged, it's the *whole point*! 🌌

Ever wanted to see what happens when you hurl a star at a supermassive black hole? Or maybe you just want to create cosmic chaos from the comfort of your browser? You're in the right universe. (Warning: May cause uncontrollable giggling and/or existential dread.)


## 🚀 See It In Action!

Why read when you can *launch*? Try the game instantly (no install, no strings attached, just pure gravitational mayhem):

👉 **[Play BlackHoleSimulatorGame on GitHub Pages!](https://rorrimaesu.github.io/BlackHoleSimulatorGame/)** 👈


## 🌠 Dazzling Demo Screenshots

Still not convinced? Feast your eyes on these 100% real, totally un-Photoshopped screenshots from the game (no planets were harmed in the making of these images – probably):

## 🖥️ How to Play Locally (for the DIY Astronaut)

1. Clone this cosmic sandbox to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RorriMaesu/BlackHoleSimulatorGame.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or whatever you use to procrastinate).

Or just [play online](https://rorrimaesu.github.io/BlackHoleSimulatorGame/) and save yourself the trouble (and the light-years of download time)!



## 🎮 Controls

**Desktop Astronauts:**
- Click the simulation to aim (pew pew!)
- WASD to move your cosmic cannon
- Mouse to aim
- Click to fire celestial objects into the void
- Use sliders and selectors to adjust gravity, power, and projectile type (yes, you can launch black holes)

**Mobile Space Cadets:**
- Use on-screen joysticks to move and aim
- Tap the giant "FIRE" button to launch (satisfaction guaranteed)



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering (space never looked so good)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for UI styling (because astronauts deserve nice buttons)
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic (no frameworks, just pure cosmic code)
